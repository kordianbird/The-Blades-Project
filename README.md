# The Blades Project

My project is an official website for a fictional band called "The Blades"

# UX

Existing fans along with new fans are eager to find out more about their favourite band and to keep up with the bands everyday lives through
social media.

My webiste aims to address the fans goals by adding information about the band members, news section to show whats new with the band, gallery
section to give samples of the band's music and tour dates.

* as a new fan, I want to check out the bands best tracks to find a new favourite song 

* as a fan, I would like to find out more about the band's history to get a better understanding of their lyrics

* as a fan, I would love to find out when and where the next concert is going to be held so I can book the tickets
