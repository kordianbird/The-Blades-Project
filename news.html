                <p>Steven loves animals so it's no surprise that he finally adopted a retired greyhound which he always wanted. Right now he owns two Huskys, one German Shephard, 
                    a bunny and now also a Greyhound!

                <p>The Blades have now toured around Ireland twice but with the band's growing popularity it's about time to take a tour around Europe. As of right now they are
                    planning to visit their fans in Germany, Sweden, Poland and France although some countries will be added to the list considering the band's growing fanbase.

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>In a recent interview with Ozzy Osbourne he was asked what inspired him to make his new album "Ordinary Man". Ozzy responded "I took a break from singing in 2019
                    and spent some time browsing trending songs on Spotify to listen to, I came across "The Blades" and I immediately got hooked on them. Their song writing really
                    immpressed me and inspired me to make another album"

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>Don't worry! Steven isn't leaving The Blades but he has always wanted to release his own song to show his fans that he really enjoys writing songs and that he
                    can write something just as good as the band's already impressive songs.
